Throughout this project, I got to stretch my understanding of Python in ways that felt both practical and exciting. 
I learned how to navigate Git and GitHub with more confidence; moving between repositories, pushing changes, and keeping my work organized. 

On the programming side, I strengthened my grasp of loops, especially using for and while loops to manage repetitive tasks. 
Working with lists to store and structure information also became much more intuitive. 
One of the biggest steps forward for me, though, was learning about classes and Object-Oriented Programming.

The most challenging part was understanding how inheritance actually works, specifically how attributes and methods move from a parent class to a child class. 
At first, I kept losing track of what belonged where and how everything connected or put everything together inside one class. 
But once I realized that inheritance simply allows a child class to reuse and extend the parent’s structure, the overall logic of OOP finally made sense.

If I had more time, I would focus on extending the project to support multiple users at once 
and implement a system that saves user data even after the program is closed. 
That way, when a user logs back in, their information would still be right where they left it. 
Overall, this project pushed me to think more critically about how programs are built, and it gave me skills I’m excited to keep developing.
